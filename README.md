# MoPedS
Mongoose Pedigree Scripts

R scripts to simplify the process of updating the Banded Mongoose Research Project pedigree.
The pedigree is created using the R package MasterBayes and the stand alone software COLONY2.
MoPedS automatically generates the input files for these programs, assigns parentage, checks the assignments, combines the results, checks for errors in the input data, produces a report on the pedigree, and can be used to simulate pedigrees.
Although heavily geared towards the specifics of the banded mongoose research project it can also be used to easily generate input data for COLONY2 for other projects.
